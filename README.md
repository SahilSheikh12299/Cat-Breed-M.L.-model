# Cat-Breed-M.L.-model
This is a machine learning Image classification model which is trained using the pictures of 5 cat breeds.
I will keep updating this model as my skills grow as a machine learning engineer.
The prediction score as of now is around 54%, I'l be updating this score as I get better at machine learning.
